# Test Guard Trigger

This file is created to test the Route & Adapter Invariants Guard workflow.

## What This Tests

1. **Workflow Trigger**: Ensures the workflow runs when files are modified
2. **Guard Logic**: Verifies the SHA reference fix works correctly
3. **Path Detection**: Confirms the workflow can detect UI vs protected area changes

## Expected Behavior

- Workflow should start automatically
- Guard should run and detect this is not a UI-only PR
- Guard should skip (no UI components changed)
- Workflow should complete successfully

## Next Steps

After this test passes:
1. Create a UI-only PR to test guard passing
2. Create a mixed PR to test guard failing
3. Verify error messages are clear and helpful
