# AI Evaluations: Finalize & Quarantine (v1) - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a CI hardening patch for AI Evaluations that makes them optional, safe, and well-documented.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Normalized AI Evaluations Workflow
- **File:** `.github/workflows/ai-evaluations.yml`
- **Key Features:**
  - Runs only when PR has `ai-evals` label OR manually triggered
  - Provides clear PR comments explaining what happened
  - Uploads artifacts from `artifacts/ai-evals/**` if present
  - Gracefully handles missing evaluation scripts
  - Uses proper GitHub Actions permissions (read contents, write PRs/issues)

### 2. Label Bootstrap Workflow
- **File:** `.github/workflows/label-bootstrap.yml`
- **Purpose:** Creates/ensures the `ai-evals` label exists
- **Usage:** Run manually once via Actions â†’ Label Bootstrap â†’ Run workflow

### 3. Documentation
- **File:** `docs/ci-ai-evaluations.md`
- **Content:** Complete guide for setup, usage, and customization
- **Includes:** Setup steps, workflow behavior, typical use cases

### 4. Artifacts Directory
- **Path:** `artifacts/ai-evals/`
- **Purpose:** Standard location for evaluation outputs
- **Includes:** `.gitkeep` file to ensure directory is tracked

### 5. Package.json Scripts
- **Status:** Already present (no changes needed)
- **Scripts:** `ai:evaluate` and `ai:eval:ci` stubs that exit cleanly

## Workflow Behavior

### PRs without `ai-evals` label:
- Workflow runs but skips evaluation steps
- Posts comment: "ðŸ›ˆ **AI Evaluations** skipped â€” add the `ai-evals` label to this PR (or run manually from *Actions*) to execute."

### PRs with `ai-evals` label:
- Workflow runs full evaluation pipeline
- If scripts exist: executes and uploads artifacts
- If no scripts: posts comment explaining nothing to run
- Always provides feedback via PR comments

### Manual triggers:
- Bypass label check
- Always attempt to run evaluations
- Useful for testing or ad-hoc runs

## Acceptance Criteria Met

âœ… **Actions sidebar shows AI Evaluations and Label Bootstrap**  
âœ… **Label Bootstrap creates/confirms `ai-evals` label**  
âœ… **PRs without label â†’ AI Evaluations job skips with explanatory comment**  
âœ… **PRs with label â†’ job runs and handles script presence gracefully**  
âœ… **Artifacts from `artifacts/ai-evals/**` are uploaded when present**  
âœ… **Comprehensive documentation provided**  
âœ… **Stub scripts prevent 404s**  

## Next Steps

1. **Bootstrap labels:** Run Label Bootstrap workflow once
2. **Test:** Add `ai-evals` label to any PR to trigger evaluations
3. **Customize:** Replace stub scripts with real evaluation logic when ready

## Files Modified/Created

- `.github/workflows/ai-evaluations.yml` (updated)
- `.github/workflows/label-bootstrap.yml` (new)
- `docs/ci-ai-evaluations.md` (new)
- `artifacts/ai-evals/.gitkeep` (new)

## Safety Features

- **Label-gated:** Never runs automatically on PRs
- **Graceful degradation:** Handles missing scripts cleanly
- **Clear feedback:** Always explains what happened
- **No blocking:** Never prevents PR merges
- **Manual override:** Can be triggered manually when needed

The implementation follows the project's universal header conventions and provides a robust, safe foundation for AI evaluations that can be easily customized when needed.
