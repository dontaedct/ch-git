# AI Live Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

**Option B chosen**: Created a tiny, public placeholder page at `/ai/live` with conditional link display.

## Files changed

1. **`app/ai/live/page.tsx`** (new file)
   - Minimal placeholder page with "Coming soon" message
   - Exports `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` for universal header compliance
   - Consistent styling with project's base layout
   - Public route - no authentication required

2. **`app/page.tsx`** (modified)
   - Added conditional rendering for AI Live link
   - Link only shows when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_LIVE === "1"`
   - Maintains existing structure and styling

## Environment variable

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_LIVE`**: Set to `"1"` to enable the link, otherwise hidden
- Default behavior: Link is hidden (safe default)

## Route protection status

✅ **No changes to middleware** - `/ai/*` routes remain public  
✅ **No changes to auth guards** - Only `/client-portal` and `/sessions` remain protected  
✅ **No changes to probe/health** - Both still return 200 and remain public  

## Verification checklist

### Local testing
- [ ] Without flag: Landing shows no AI link; `/ai/live` returns 200 (placeholder page)
- [ ] With flag: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_LIVE=1` → Landing shows AI link; `/ai/live` returns 200

### Preview deployment
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_LIVE=1` in Vercel Preview environment
- [ ] Confirm `/ai/live` returns 200 in preview

### Production
- [ ] Keep flag unset (link hidden by default)
- [ ] `/ai/live` still accessible and returns 200

## Security considerations

- ✅ Route remains public (no auth required)
- ✅ No CSP changes
- ✅ No middleware protection changes
- ✅ Minimal surface area for potential issues
- ✅ Easy to disable via environment variable

## Rollback plan

If issues arise:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_LIVE` to any value other than `"1"` to hide the link
2. The placeholder page remains accessible but won't be linked from landing
3. Can be completely removed by deleting `app/ai/live/` directory

## Migration notes

This implementation brings the landing improvements from the previous 'my-app' project into 'ch-git', making it the single source of truth for production deployment.
