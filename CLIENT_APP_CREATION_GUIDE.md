## üöÄ Summary of Architectural Changes

### ‚úÖ What Was Implemented
1. **Complete Client-Scoped Architecture:** All development tools are now client-specific with dedicated workspaces
2. **New Route Structure:**
   - `/clients` - Client selection and management interface
   - `/clients/[clientId]` - Individual client workspace dashboard
   - `/clients/[clientId]/customize/*` - Client-scoped customization tools
   - `/clients/[clientId]/testing` - Client-specific testing environment
   - `/clients/[clientId]/deploy` - Client-scoped deployment management
   - `/clients/[clientId]/handover` - Client-specific handover process
3. **Agency Management:**
   - `/admin` - Centralized agency oversight and management
   - Maintained existing monitoring and system management tools
4. **Graduation System:** Complete architecture for transitioning clients from shared to standalone environments

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits Achieved
- **Client Isolation:** Every action is now scoped to a specific client
- **Clear Context:** No confusion about "which client" - always explicit
- **Scalability:** Architecture supports unlimited clients with independent workflows
- **Security:** Multi-tenant data isolation with client-specific access controls
- **Handover Ready:** Complete documentation and training system for client delivery

### ‚úÖ Architectural Problem Solved
**Original Issue:** Agency-level tools without client context led to confusion ("no app is selected so what will happen?")

**Solution:** Client-scoped workspaces where every tool, form, workflow, and deployment is explicitly tied to a specific client, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring proper context throughout the development process.
