# CRITICAL CSS RESTORATION PROMPT

## SITUATION
The user's Next.js application has lost ALL styling and now displays as unstyled text like a 2000s website. This affects ALL pages in the application. The CSS restoration attempt failed.

## WHAT HAPPENED
1. User reported all pages looking "unfinished and ugly" 
2. Found that `app/globals.css` was empty (only contained `/* Minimal CSS */`)
3. Restored CSS from `app/globals.css.backup` using `copy "app\globals.css.backup" "app\globals.css"`
4. Restarted development server
5. Server responds with 200 OK and 29,089 bytes of content
6. BUT pages still display as unstyled text

## CURRENT STATE
- Server running on localhost:3000 ✅
- CSS file restored ✅  
- Server responding ✅
- BUT styling still not applied ❌

## INVESTIGATION NEEDED
1. **Check if CSS is actually being imported in layout.tsx**
2. **Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured**
3. **Check if there are CSS compilation errors**
4. **Verify the CSS file content is correct**
5. **Check browser developer tools for CSS loading errors**
6. **Look for conflicting CSS files or imports**

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. **Read the current `app/globals.css` file** to verify it contains the full CSS
2. **Check `app/layout.tsx`** to ensure it imports `./globals.css`
3. **Verify `tailwind.config.cjs`** is properly configured
4. **Check browser console** for CSS loading errors
5. **Look for any CSS compilation errors** in the terminal
6. **Test if Tailwind classes are being processed**

## EXPECTED CSS CONTENT
The globals.css should contain:
- `@tailwind base;`
- `@tailwind components;` 
- `@tailwind utilities;`
- Comprehensive design system variables
- Component styles
- Dark/light theme support

## DEBUGGING STEPS
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check Network tab for CSS file loading
3. Check Console for CSS errors
4. Inspect elements to see if Tailwind classes are applied
5. Check if CSS variables are defined in :root

## POTENTIAL ISSUES
- CSS file not being imported in layout
- Tailwind CSS not processing the classes
- CSS compilation errors
- Conflicting CSS files
- Build cache issues
- CSS file corruption during copy

## USER EXPECTATION
All pages should display with:
- Modern styling
- Proper typography
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive design
- Component styling
- Animations and transitions

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Pages display with modern styling
- Tailwind classes are applied
- CSS variables are working
- Dark/light theme switching works
- All components are properly styled

## FILES TO CHECK
- `app/globals.css` - Main CSS file
- `app/layout.tsx` - Layout with CSS import
- `tailwind.config.cjs` - Tailwind configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- Browser developer tools - Runtime errors

## COMMAND TO START
Begin by reading the current state of `app/globals.css` and `app/layout.tsx` to understand why the CSS isn't being applied despite the file being restored.
