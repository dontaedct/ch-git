# HT-034.2.4: User Consultation Requirements

**Date Created:** September 21, 2025
**Task:** HT-034.2.4 - User Consultation Requirements for Dependency Resolution
**Priority:** Critical
**Consultation Type:** Technical Architecture Decisions

## Overview

As part of HT-034.2.4 Dependency Resolution Implementation Plan, several critical architectural decisions require user consultation before proceeding. These decisions impact system architecture, development workflow, and future maintainability.

## Critical Decisions Requiring User Approval

### 1. Server-Client Architecture Strategy (CRITICAL APPROVAL NEEDED)

#### Current Issue
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` imports "server-only" and "next/headers"
- These server-only modules are being imported in client-side context
- Causing critical build failures preventing compilation

#### Decision Options

**Option A: Create Parallel Client-Safe Modules (RECOMMENDED)**
```typescript
// Current: lib/supabase/server.ts (server-only)
// Create: lib/supabase/client.ts (client-safe)
// Maintain: lib/supabase/index.ts (smart exports)
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Clean separation, type safety, scalable
- ✅ **Pros:** Maintains server functionality, clear boundaries
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Requires code duplication, more files to maintain
- **Impact:** Moderate development effort, long-term maintainability

**Option B: Dynamic Import Strategy**
```typescript
// Use dynamic imports for server-only modules
const { createServerSupabase } = await import('@/lib/supabase/server');
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Minimal code changes, preserves existing structure
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Runtime overhead, complex error handling
- ⚠️ **Cons:** TypeScript complexity, debugging challenges
- **Impact:** Low development effort, potential performance issues

**Option C: Conditional Module Loading**
```typescript
// Check environment and load appropriate module
const supabase = typeof window === 'undefined'
  ? await import('@/lib/supabase/server')
  : await import('@/lib/supabase/client');
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Single interface, environment-aware
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Complex logic, potential runtime errors
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Testing complexity, bundle size impact
- **Impact:** Medium development effort, moderate complexity

#### **RECOMMENDATION:** Option A - Create Parallel Client-Safe Modules
- **Rationale:** Clean architecture, future-proof, explicit boundaries
- **Implementation:** 4-6 hours development time
- **Risk:** Low, well-established pattern

### 2. Import Path Standardization Strategy

#### Current Issue
- Mixed import patterns: `@ui/components/*` vs `@/components/ui/*`
- tsconfig.json supports both but build fails on `@ui/components/*`
- Inconsistent developer experience

#### Decision Options

**Option A: Standardize on @/components/ui/* (RECOMMENDED)**
```typescript
// Replace all: import { Card } from '@ui/components/card';
// With: import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card';
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Already working, consistent with existing codebase
- ✅ **Pros:** TypeScript resolution confirmed functional
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Requires updating existing imports
- **Impact:** 2-3 hours find/replace effort

**Option B: Fix @ui Path Resolution**
```json
// Investigate and fix tsconfig.json @ui path resolution
// Keep existing @ui/components/* imports
```
- ✅ **Pros:** No import changes needed
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Root cause investigation required
- ⚠️ **Cons:** May uncover deeper configuration issues
- **Impact:** Unknown time investment, higher risk

**Option C: Support Both Patterns**
```typescript
// Maintain both @ui/* and @/components/* patterns
// Update documentation for preferred usage
```
- ✅ **Pros:** No immediate breaking changes
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Continued inconsistency, developer confusion
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Maintenance overhead, potential future issues
- **Impact:** Ongoing complexity, not recommended

#### **RECOMMENDATION:** Option A - Standardize on @/components/ui/*
- **Rationale:** Proven working, consistent, reduces complexity
- **Implementation:** Systematic find/replace with validation
- **Risk:** Very low, mechanical change

### 3. TypeScript Error Resolution Approach

#### Current Issue
- 25+ TypeScript compilation errors across HT-033 components
- Syntax errors preventing build completion
- Mix of import errors and component structure issues

#### Decision Options

**Option A: Comprehensive Immediate Fix (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Fix all TypeScript errors in single implementation cycle
# Systematic error resolution with testing
# Complete build restoration
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Complete resolution, clean slate for development
- ✅ **Pros:** Unblocks entire HT-034 process
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Requires 6-8 hours focused effort
- **Impact:** High initial effort, significant productivity improvement

**Option B: Staged Error Resolution**
```bash
# Fix critical build-blocking errors first
# Address remaining errors in subsequent phases
# Partial build restoration
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Faster initial progress, iterative improvement
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Continued build instability, partial functionality
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Risk of error proliferation
- **Impact:** Lower initial effort, ongoing instability

**Option C: Temporary Error Suppression**
```typescript
// Use @ts-ignore or skipLibCheck temporarily
// Focus on functional implementation first
// Address errors later
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Immediate build success, fast unblocking
- ❌ **Cons:** Technical debt accumulation, type safety loss
- ❌ **Cons:** Potential runtime errors, debugging difficulties
- **Impact:** Very fast short-term, significant long-term risk

#### **RECOMMENDATION:** Option A - Comprehensive Immediate Fix
- **Rationale:** Proper foundation, type safety, long-term stability
- **Implementation:** Systematic error categorization and resolution
- **Risk:** Low with proper testing strategy

### 4. Development Workflow During Fixes

#### Current Issue
- Build currently fails completely
- Development workflow blocked
- Testing and validation required

#### Decision Options

**Option A: Complete Fix Before Development Resumption**
```bash
# Complete all dependency resolution before other work
# Single-focus approach until build restored
# All team members wait for completion
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Clean implementation, no interference
- ✅ **Pros:** Complete testing validation
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Blocks other development work
- **Impact:** 1-2 day pause in development

**Option B: Parallel Development with Feature Branches**
```bash
# Fix dependencies on dedicated branch
# Continue other work on separate branches
# Merge fixes when ready
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Continued development progress
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Potential merge conflicts
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Testing complexity
- **Impact:** Continued progress, coordination overhead

**Option C: Rolling Fix Implementation**
```bash
# Fix components as needed for development
# Just-in-time error resolution
# Partial build success acceptance
```
- ✅ **Pros:** Immediate partial unblocking
- ⚠️ **Cons:** Continued build instability
- ❌ **Cons:** Technical debt accumulation
- **Impact:** Short-term progress, long-term problems

#### **RECOMMENDATION:** Option A - Complete Fix Before Development Resumption
- **Rationale:** Solid foundation prevents future issues
- **Implementation:** Focused 1-2 day effort
- **Risk:** Low, prevents cascading problems

## User Consultation Process

### Immediate Consultation Required

#### Questions for User Decision:
1. **Server-Client Architecture:** Approve Option A (parallel client-safe modules)?
2. **Import Standardization:** Approve Option A (@/components/ui/* standardization)?
3. **TypeScript Resolution:** Approve Option A (comprehensive immediate fix)?
4. **Development Workflow:** Approve Option A (complete fix before resumption)?

#### Additional Considerations:
- **Budget Impact:** Estimated 8-12 hours total implementation time
- **Timeline Impact:** 1-2 day pause in development for complete resolution
- **Risk Assessment:** All recommended options are low-risk with high benefit
- **Alternative Paths:** Fallback options available if preferred approaches rejected
