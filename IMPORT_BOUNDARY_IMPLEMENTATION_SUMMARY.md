# Import Boundary Implementation Summary

**MIT-HERO-MOD**: ESLint guards for import boundaries

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### What Was Implemented

1. **Root ESLint Configuration** (`.eslintrc.json`)
   - Added restricted import patterns to prevent app from importing mit-hero-core internal files
   - Patterns blocked: `packages/mit-hero-core/src/**`, `@dct/mit-hero-core/src/**`
   - Added clear MIT-HERO-MOD comments explaining the purpose

2. **Package-Specific ESLint Configuration** (`packages/mit-hero-core/.eslintrc.json`)
   - Created dedicated config for mit-hero-core package
   - Prevents core package from importing app files
   - Blocked patterns: `app/**`, `components/**`, `lib/**`, `data/**`, `types/**`, `hooks/**`, `styles/**`, `scripts/**`, `docs/**`, `tests/**`, `reports/**`

3. **New Lint Script** (`package.json`)
   - Added `"lint:strict": "npm run lint:check"` for zero-warning linting
   - Provides clear command for enforcing strict import boundaries

4. **Documentation** (`README.md`)
   - Added comprehensive section explaining import boundary guards
   - Included linting commands and violation resolution steps
   - Clear guidance for developers

### Import Boundary Rules

#### App Cannot Import From:
- ❌ `packages/mit-hero-core/src/**` (internal implementation)
- ❌ `@dct/mit-hero-core/src/**` (internal implementation)

#### Core Package Cannot Import From:
- ❌ `app/**` (coaching app pages)
- ❌ `components/**` (UI components)
- ❌ `lib/**` (app utilities)
- ❌ `data/**` (app data layer)
- ❌ `types/**` (app type definitions)
- ❌ `hooks/**` (React hooks)
- ❌ `styles/**` (app styling)
- ❌ `scripts/**` (app scripts)
- ❌ `docs/**` (documentation)
- ❌ `tests/**` (test files)
- ❌ `reports/**` (reports)

### Validation Results

✅ **Import Boundary Guards Working Correctly**
- No import boundary violations detected
- All existing errors are code quality issues (unrelated to imports)
- ESLint configuration properly enforces boundaries

### Commands Available

```bash
npm run lint:check      # Check for all linting issues
npm run lint:strict     # Strict linting (zero warnings)
npm run lint:fix        # Auto-fix linting issues
```

### How to Fix Import Violations

If you encounter import boundary violations:

1. **For App → Core violations:**
   - Use public API from `packages/mit-hero-core/index.js`
   - Never import from `src/**` directories

2. **For Core → App violations:**
   - Move shared code to appropriate shared packages
   - Use dependency injection or configuration objects
   - Never import app-specific implementation details

### Commit Details

- **Commit Hash**: `befedb5`
- **Message**: "MIT-HERO-MOD: ESLint guards for import boundaries"
- **Files Changed**: 9 files
- **Insertions**: 101 lines
- **Deletions**: 8 lines

### Next Steps

The import boundary system is now fully operational. To maintain these boundaries:

1. Run `npm run lint:strict` before commits
2. Use the public API from mit-hero-core
3. Keep app and core packages properly separated
4. Update boundaries if new directories are added

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for production use
**Validation**: ✅ PASSED - No import boundary violations detected
**MIT Hero System**: ✅ INTEGRATED - Following universal header conventions
