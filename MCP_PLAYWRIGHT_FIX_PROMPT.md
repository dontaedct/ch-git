**Date:** September 25, 2025

## **CRITICAL ISSUE**
MCP Playwright browser is returning "Not connected" error when trying to navigate to localhost:3000. This is blocking Cursor AI functionality.

## **CURRENT STATUS**
- ‚úÖ Development server running on port 3000 (PID 158240)
- ‚úÖ HTTP responses returning 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Playwright installed (version 1.55.0)
- ‚ùå MCP browser connection failing with "Not connected" error

## **ERROR DETAILS**
```
Tool: browser_navigate, Result: {"error":"Not connected"}
Tool: browser_install, Result: {"error":"Not connected"}
```

## **SYSTEM INFORMATION**
- **OS:** Windows 10 (10.0.26100)
- **Shell:** PowerShell
- **Project:** Next.js application
- **Port:** 3000 (confirmed listening)
- **Playwright Version:** 1.55.0

## **REQUIRED ACTIONS**

### **1. DIAGNOSE MCP CONNECTION ISSUE**
```bash
# Check if MCP server is running
# Verify MCP configuration
# Check browser installation status
```

### **2. FIX BROWSER CONNECTION**
```bash
# Reinstall Playwright browsers
npx playwright install --force

# Install system dependencies
npx playwright install-deps

# Test browser launch manually
npx playwright test --headed
```

### **3. VERIFY MCP FUNCTIONALITY**
```bash
# Test MCP browser navigation
# Verify localhost:3000 accessibility
# Confirm Cursor AI integration
```

## **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

### **IMMEDIATE TESTS NEEDED**
1. **MCP Browser Connection Test**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Take screenshot of homepage
   - Verify page content loads

2. **Cursor AI Integration Test**
   - Confirm MCP tools are accessible
   - Test browser automation functions
   - Verify error handling

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- ‚úÖ MCP browser connects successfully
- ‚úÖ Can navigate to localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Can take screenshots and interact with pages
- ‚úÖ Cursor AI can use MCP tools

## **TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS**

### **Step 1: Check MCP Server Status**
```bash
# Verify MCP server is running
# Check for any MCP-related processes
# Verify configuration files
```

### **Step 2: Browser Installation Fix**
```bash
# Force reinstall all browsers
npx playwright install --force

# Install Windows dependencies
npx playwright install-deps

# Verify browser binaries exist
```

### **Step 3: Connection Test**
```bash
# Test manual browser launch
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium

# Test MCP browser connection
# Verify localhost accessibility
```

## **EXPECTED OUTCOME**
After fixing, MCP Playwright browser should:
- ‚úÖ Connect successfully to localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Allow Cursor AI to perform browser automation
- ‚úÖ Enable screenshot capture and page interaction
- ‚úÖ Support full MCP functionality for development

## **URGENCY LEVEL**
üî¥ **CRITICAL** - This is blocking Cursor AI functionality and development workflow.

## **CONTEXT**
This is a Next.js application with a development server running on port 3000. The server is working correctly (returning 200 OK responses), but the MCP Playwright browser cannot connect to it. This prevents Cursor AI from using browser automation tools for testing and development.

## üéâ **FIX SUMMARY**
**Resolution Date:** September 25, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

### **Root Cause Identified**
The "Not connected" error was caused by missing or corrupted Playwright browser binaries, preventing MCP from launching browser instances.

### **Actions Taken**
1. **Diagnosis Completed**
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed development server accessible on port 3000 (HTTP 200 OK)
   - ‚úÖ Verified Playwright v1.55.0 installation
   - ‚úÖ Identified browser binary corruption

2. **Fix Applied**
   ```bash
   # Force reinstalled Playwright Chromium browser
