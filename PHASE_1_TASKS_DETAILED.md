# PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & INFRASTRUCTURE - DETAILED TASKS

**Branch**: `ops/phase-1-foundation`  
**Goal**: Solid foundation for everything else  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Ready to Start

---

## **TASK 01: Baseline repo snapshot & risk log**

### **CONTEXT**
- **Date Check**: Before doing anything, print the current local date/time in ISO (Node one-liner ok). Include it in your final summary as `RUN_DATE=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`.
- **Overall Goal**: Turn the "DCT Microâ€‘Apps" template into a productionâ€‘grade, configâ€‘driven, modular monolith that can be cloned per client in under an hour, with tier switches, observability, CI/CD, security, and a warnâ€‘butâ€‘run env philosophy.
- **This Task**: Create a **baseline snapshot** and **risk log** so we always know what changed and why.
- **Previous Task**: (none â€” this is the starting point).
- **Next Task**: #02 Env schema + `env:doctor` CLI to implement our warnâ€‘butâ€‘run environment strategy.

### **RULES**
1) Work in branch `ops/phase-1-foundation` - this is the first commit of Phase 1.
2) Never delete code without a backup. If you must move/rename, do in small commits.
3) Detect the repo's package manager and keep using it (npm|pnpm|yarn). Do not switch.
4) Follow our loop: Audit â†’ Decide â†’ Apply â†’ Verify. When uncertain, propose options with tradeoffs and pick one, documenting why in a short ADR.
5) Respect existing coding styles and frameworks. Assume Next.js App Router, Node 22, Supabase, Resend, Vercel unless repo indicates otherwise.
6) Keep the template runnable without secrets. If a feature requires secrets, featureâ€‘flag it off and surface a gentle warning.
7) Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `style:`

### **TASKS**
A. **Audit**: Generate and save to `/docs/ops/baseline/` the following (machineâ€‘readable where possible):
   - `file-tree.md` (top 3 levels) and `routes.md` (Next routes + method summary).
   - `packages.md` listing prod/deps + versions; `scripts.md` capturing npm scripts.
   - `config-inventory.md` for env vars discovered across the codebase.
   - `testing-inventory.md` and current coverage (if configured).
   - `ci-inventory.md` summarizing any existing CI jobs.
   - `security-inventory.md` for auth patterns, RLS policies, and security gaps.
   - `performance-inventory.md` for current bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
   - `accessibility-inventory.md` for current a11y patterns and gaps.
B. **Decide**: Create `docs/adr/0001-baseline-and-risks.md` capturing:
   - Assumed stack, known gaps, risks (env handling, CI, security, perf, a11y, observability).
   - Decision: proceed with the modular monolith + config/presets + feature flags plan.
   - Risk mitigation strategies for each identified gap.
   - Technology stack validation and compatibility matrix.
C. **Apply**: Add a tiny internal script `tools/ops/run-date.ts` that prints ISO date; used by future prompts.
D. **Verify**: Repo builds; docs generated; commit history readable.

### **DELIVERABLES**
- `/docs/ops/baseline/*` inventories (8 files total)
- `/docs/adr/0001-baseline-and-risks.md`
- `tools/ops/run-date.ts`
- Commit with message: `feat(ops): baseline snapshot, inventories, and risk ADR`

### **VERIFICATION**
- Run `node tools/ops/run-date.ts` â†’ prints ISO datetime.
- Open `/docs/ops/baseline/file-tree.md` and confirm content.
- No runtime behavior changes.
- All 8 inventory files are present and contain meaningful data.
- Open a PR titled `[Phase 1] Baseline snapshot & risk log` and attach the inventories as artifacts if CI exists.

### **IF ISSUES**
- Roll back only the new docs/scripts; do not touch app code. Re-run with smaller scopes.
- Document any failures in `/docs/ops/baseline/implementation-notes.md`

## **TASK 02: Environment schema + env:doctor (warnâ€‘butâ€‘run)**

### **CONTEXT**
- **Date Check**: Print RUN_DATE in ISO; include in summary.
- **Overall Goal**: Productionâ€‘grade template with gentle env warnings and features autoâ€‘disabled when secrets are missing.
- **This Task**: Implement typed env validation + doctor CLI.
- **Previous Task**: #01 baseline inventories & risk ADR.
- **Next Task**: #03 Diagnostics admin route displaying env and health.

### **RULES**
1) Continue working in branch `ops/phase-1-foundation` - this is the second commit of Phase 1.
2) Use `zod` for schema validation. No leaking secrets in logs or error messages.
3) If a var is missing, set an explicit placeholder (e.g., `PLACEHOLDER_RESEND_API_KEY`) and **disable** the dependent feature via a feature flag.
4) Add humanâ€‘readable warnings in dev console and on the diagnostics page (to be built next).
5) Implement environment variable encryption for sensitive values in production.
6) Add environment variable rotation detection and warnings.
7) Include environment variable validation and sanitization.

### **TASKS**
A. **Audit**: From `config-inventory.md`, enumerate all env vars; classify as REQUIRED|OPTIONAL per feature.
B. **Decide**: Organize into modules: `env.app`, `env.integrations`, `env.security`, `env.observability`.
C. **Apply**: 
   - Create `packages/lib/env.ts` exporting typed, validated env with runtime validation.
   - Create `.env.example` with commented explanations, placeholders, and security notes.
   - Add `npm run env:doctor` â†’ prints a table: Name | Required? | Set? | Using Placeholder? | Feature Impact | Security Level.
   - Wire feature flags: `packages/lib/flags.ts` with `isEnabled('stripe')`, `isTier('pro')`, etc. Defaults safe.
   - Add environment variable encryption utilities for production deployments.
   - Implement environment variable validation and sanitization.
D. **Verify**: Run without real secrets. App should build and run with warnings, not crashes.

### **DELIVERABLES**
- `packages/lib/env.ts`, `packages/lib/flags.ts`
- `.env.example`, `scripts/env-doctor.*`
- `packages/lib/env-encryption.ts` for production security
- `packages/lib/env-validation.ts` for validation and sanitization
- Docs: `/docs/ops/env.md` describing categories, impacts, and security considerations.
- Commit: `feat(env): typed env schema + env doctor + feature flags + encryption + validation`

### **VERIFICATION**
- `npm run env:doctor` shows table with accurate statuses and security levels.
- Starting dev server shows warnings but app remains usable.
- Unit tests for `env.ts` (missing/invalid â†’ fallback + disabled features).
- Environment encryption works in production mode.
- Feature flags properly disable features when secrets are missing.
- Environment validation prevents invalid values.
