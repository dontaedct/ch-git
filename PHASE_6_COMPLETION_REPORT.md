### Key Technical Achievements

#### 1. Manifest-Driven Architecture
```typescript
// Core manifest structure enabling 60-70% automation
interface TemplateManifest {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  components: BaseComponent[];
  theme: ThemeConfig;
  // ... complete type-safe structure
}
```

#### 2. Dynamic Component System
```typescript
// Registry supporting 15+ component types with versioning
class ComponentRegistry {
  registerComponent(definition: ComponentDefinition): void;
  async getComponent(type: string, version?: string): Promise<ReactComponentType<any>>;
  // ... production-ready implementation
}
```

#### 3. Real-Time Preview Integration
```typescript
// Multi-mode preview system with auto-refresh
<PreviewHarness
  manifest={template}
  autoRefresh={true}
  showControls={true}
  onInteraction={(componentId, action, data) => {
    // Auto-select interacted components
  }}
/>
```

#### 4. Comprehensive Export System
```typescript
// Multi-format export with documentation generation
const exportFormats = ['json', 'yaml', 'zip'];
const includeDocumentation = true;
const exportData = {
  manifest: template,
  metadata: { exportedAt: new Date(), version: '1.0.0' },
  documentation: generateDocs(template)
};
```
