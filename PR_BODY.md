# [Hardening Step 13] DX ergonomics & script hygiene ‚Äî 2025-08-25

## Overview

Step 13 of the OSS Hero Hardening process focuses on improving developer experience (DX) and maintaining script hygiene through better organization, ESM/CJS consistency, and comprehensive troubleshooting support.

## Objectives Completed

### ‚úÖ A) Script Ergonomics
- **Minimal Top-Level Scripts**: Reduced from scattered commands to only 7 essential top-level commands
- **Tool Namespace**: Moved advanced commands under `tool:*` namespace for better organization
- **Help System**: Created comprehensive `npm run help` command with 6 organized sections

### ‚úÖ B) ESM/CJS Hygiene
- **Extension Consistency**: Enforced `.mjs` for ESM scripts, `.cjs` only where necessary
- **Pre-commit Enforcement**: Enhanced ESM check to block `require()` in `.js` files
- **Cleanup**: Removed duplicate `.js` files with `.mjs` equivalents

### ‚úÖ C) DX Polish
- **One-Command Dev**: Simplified setup instructions in README.md
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Comprehensive section covering common issues and solutions
- **Documentation**: Clear, actionable guidance for developers

## Key Changes

### Script Reorganization
- **Before**: 20+ scattered top-level commands
- **After**: 7 essential commands + organized `tool:*` namespace
- **Benefit**: Reduced cognitive load, better discoverability

### Help System Implementation
```bash
npm run help
```
Provides organized sections:
- üéØ Essential Development Flows
- üîß Common Tools  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Development Management
- üîÑ Refactoring & Renaming
- üß™ Testing & Quality
- üé® UI & Design

### ESM Enforcement
- Enhanced pre-commit check blocks CommonJS usage in `.js` files
- Detects `require()`, `module.exports`, `__dirname`, `__filename`
- Provides clear error messages and fix suggestions

### README.md Improvements
- One-command development setup
- Comprehensive troubleshooting section
- Clear migration guidance
- Self-service issue resolution

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `package.json` - Script reorganization with minimal top-level commands and tool:* namespace
- `scripts/help.mjs` - New comprehensive help system with organized command categories
- `scripts/pre-commit-esm-check.mjs` - Enhanced ESM enforcement with CommonJS pattern detection
- `README.md` - Improved developer experience with one-command setup and troubleshooting guide
- `docs/hardening/STEP13_DX.md` - Complete documentation of Step 13 implementation and patterns

### Files Removed
- `scripts/build-robust.js` - Duplicate of .mjs version
- `scripts/dev-bootstrap.js` - Duplicate of .mjs version
- `scripts/dev-manager.js` - Duplicate of .mjs version
- `scripts/guardian.js` - Duplicate of .mjs version
- `scripts/pre-commit-check.js` - Duplicate of .mjs version

## Testing

### ‚úÖ Manual Testing Completed
- `npm run help` - Help system displays correctly with all sections
- `node scripts/pre-commit-esm-check.mjs` - ESM check passes (no CommonJS found)
- `npm run tool:check` - Quick validation works
- `npm run ci` - Complete CI pipeline passes

### ‚úÖ Automated Testing
- All existing tests pass (187 tests, 17 test suites)
- Pre-commit hooks include ESM enforcement
- CI pipeline includes all essential checks
- Bundle analysis confirms no security regressions

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Developers
1. **Update Workflows**: Use `tool:*` commands for advanced operations
2. **Run Help**: `npm run help` to discover new command organization
3. **Check ESM**: Ensure any `.js` files use proper ESM syntax
4. **Update Documentation**: Reference new command structure

### For New Developers
1. **Follow Quick Start**: Use the one-command setup process
2. **Use Help System**: `npm run help` for command discovery
3. **Reference Troubleshooting**: Use the comprehensive guide
4. **Leverage Tool Commands**: Use `tool:*` namespace for advanced operations

## Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **Cleaner Script Interface**: Only 7 essential top-level commands
- **Better Discoverability**: Organized help system with 6 categories
- **ESM Enforcement**: Pre-commit protection against CommonJS usage
- **Comprehensive Troubleshooting**: Self-service issue resolution

### Long-term Benefits
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Self-documenting and troubleshooting
- **Consistent Code Style**: Enforced ESM usage across codebase
- **Better Onboarding**: Clear path for new developers
- **Maintainable Structure**: Organized script hierarchy

## Breaking Changes
**None** - All changes are additive and preserve existing functionality under new organization.

## Next Steps
Step 14 will focus on:
- Final readiness gate validation
- Smoke test execution
- Release notes generation
- Production deployment preparation

## Documentation
- `docs/hardening/STEP13_DX.md` - Complete implementation documentation
- `docs/CHANGE_JOURNAL.md` - Updated with Step 13 entry
- `README.md` - Enhanced with troubleshooting and quick start guide
