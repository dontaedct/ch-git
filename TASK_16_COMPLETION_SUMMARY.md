## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### Test Structure
```

├── index.test.ts                 # Main test runner and summary
├── n8n.contract.test.ts          # N8N integration tests
├── resend.contract.test.ts       # Resend integration tests
└── openai.contract.test.ts       # OpenAI integration tests
```

### Key Features
1. **Comprehensive Mocking** - All external services properly mocked
2. **Error Handling Validation** - Rate limiting, auth failures, timeouts
3. **Performance Contracts** - Response time expectations and rate limits
4. **Security Validation** - API keys, webhook signatures, data encryption
5. **Monitoring Integration** - Request logging and metrics collection

## 🧪 Test Categories Implemented

### 1. N8N Contract Tests (28 tests)
- **Webhook Integration:** Event emission and payload validation
- **Reliability Client:** Health checks, workflow triggering, circuit breaker
- **Event Schema:** PDF downloads, booking requests, client intake
- **Error Handling:** Service unavailability, timeouts, signature verification

### 2. Resend Contract Tests (35 tests)
- **Email Sending:** Basic emails, attachments, custom headers
- **Email Tracking:** List sent emails, delivery status
- **Domain Management:** Domain verification and DKIM setup
- **API Key Management:** Key creation, rotation, deletion
- **Error Handling:** Invalid emails, rate limiting, domain verification

### 3. OpenAI Contract Tests (40 tests)
- **Chat Completions:** Basic chat, system messages, function calling
- **Model Management:** Model listing and selection
- **Embeddings:** Text embedding generation
- **Image Generation:** DALL-E image creation
- **Audio Transcription:** Whisper audio processing
- **Error Handling:** Rate limiting, invalid API keys, content filtering

## 🚀 Test Execution

### Available Commands
```bash
# Run all contract tests
npm run test:contracts

# Run individual service tests
npm run test:contracts:n8n
