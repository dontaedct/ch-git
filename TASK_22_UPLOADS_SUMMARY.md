# Task 22: Uploads & Storage - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

**SOS Operation Phase 4 Task 22 - IMPLEMENTED**

## What Was Built
- Supabase storage bucket `media` (private) with service-role policies only.
- `media` table with RLS to track uploads per client:
  - Columns: `client_id`, `path`, `filename`, `mime_type`, `size_bytes`, timestamps
  - RLS: users can insert/select/delete own rows based on `clients.email = auth.jwt()->>'email'`
- API routes under `app/api/media/`:
  - `signed-upload` (pre-existing): returns signed upload URL + token
  - `confirm-upload` (new): validates/records metadata and logs audit
- Validation: `confirmUploadSchema` in `lib/validation/index.ts`
- UI: `components/upload-widget.tsx` with direct-to-storage signed upload, then confirmation call.

## How It Works
1) Frontend requests signed upload (`/api/media/signed-upload`) with original filename.
2) Browser uploads file to Supabase Storage via `uploadToSignedUrl`.
3) Frontend posts to `/api/media/confirm-upload` with metadata.
4) API inserts `media` DB row and writes an audit event (`media_uploaded`).

## Safety & RLS
- Bucket is private; access is via signed URLs only.
- DB access enforced via RLS tied to `clients.email` ownership.
- Service role retains full management for ops/automation.

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add listing and delete endpoints for media (with RLS guard).
- Extend UI to preview images and fetch signed download URLs.
- Add MIME-type allowlist to server validations and env overrides for max size.
