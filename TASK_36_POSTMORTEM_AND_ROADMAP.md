## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Phase-gated approach**: Sequential phases with clear dependencies prevented technical debt
2. **Branch strategy**: Feature branches per phase enabled parallel development and safe rollbacks
3. **Validation at each step**: Early validation caught issues before they propagated
4. **Documentation-driven development**: Living documentation improved handover quality
5. **Toolchain integration**: Automated quality gates reduced manual oversight

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Dependency conflicts**:
   - _Challenge_: Complex dependency trees across monorepo packages
   - _Solution_: Centralized dependency management and automated conflict resolution

2. **Performance vs. feature balance**:
   - _Challenge_: Rich functionality impacting bundle size
   - _Solution_: Dynamic imports, code splitting, performance budgets

3. **Testing complexity**:
   - _Challenge_: Testing interactions between blocks and presets
   - _Solution_: Contract testing and comprehensive integration suites

4. **Security vs. usability**:
   - _Challenge_: Balancing security headers with third-party integrations
   - _Solution_: Configurable CSP with preset-specific overrides

### Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ Migrated from prototype patterns to production architecture
- ✅ Consolidated authentication flows with proper session management
- ✅ Standardized error handling across all components
- ✅ Implemented proper logging and monitoring
- ✅ Added comprehensive input validation and sanitization
