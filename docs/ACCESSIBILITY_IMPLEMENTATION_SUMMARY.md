# Accessibility Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented automated accessibility testing with Playwright + axe-core for the OSS Hero Design Safety project. The system is configured in **advisory mode** to report violations without failing tests, allowing for gradual improvement of accessibility standards.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Dependencies
- ✅ `@axe-core/playwright` - Accessibility testing engine
- ✅ `@playwright/test` - Browser automation framework
- ✅ Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

### 2. Configuration Files
- ✅ `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration with multi-browser support
- ✅ `tests/ui/a11y.config.ts` - Accessibility testing configuration and rules
- ✅ `tests/ui/a11y.spec.ts` - Comprehensive accessibility test suite
- ✅ `tests/ui/a11y-mock.spec.ts` - Mock tests for setup validation

### 3. Test Coverage

#### Critical Screens Tested
- **Homepage** (`/`) - Basic accessibility standards
- **Client Portal** (`/client-portal`) - Client-facing forms and dashboards  
- **Trainer Profile** (`/trainer-profile`) - Trainer management forms
- **Weekly Plans** (`/weekly-plans`) - Planning and scheduling interfaces

#### Test Categories
- **Automated axe-core Scans** - WCAG 2.1 Level A/AA compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Tab order, focus indicators, keyboard-only operation
- **Form Accessibility** - Input labeling, error handling, required fields
- **Content Structure** - Headings, lists, images, landmarks

### 4. Advisory Mode Configuration
```typescript
export const advisoryModeConfig = {
  failOnViolations: false, // Don't fail tests on violations
  reportViolations: true,  // But do report them
  logLevel: 'info'         // Log level for violations
};
```

## Scripts Added

```json
{
  "ui:a11y": "npx playwright test tests/ui/a11y.spec.ts --reporter=html",
  "ui:a11y:mock": "npx playwright test tests/ui/a11y-mock.spec.ts --reporter=html", 
  "ui:a11y:install": "npx playwright install"
}
```

## How to Use

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npm run ui:a11y:install
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run full accessibility test suite (requires dev server)
npm run ui:a11y

# Run mock tests (no server required, validates setup)
npm run ui:a11y:mock

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test tests/ui/a11y.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

### Test Output
- HTML reports generated in `playwright-report/` directory
- Violations logged to console (advisory mode)
- Screenshots on failure for debugging

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Playwright + axe-core integration
- Multi-browser test configuration
- Advisory mode reporting
- Mock test validation
- Comprehensive test structure

### ⚠️ Requires Dev Server
- Full accessibility tests need running application
- Dev server configuration needs ES module compatibility fix
- Tests will fail with connection refused until server is running

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Fix Dev Server** - Resolve ES module compatibility in `scripts/dev-bootstrap.js`
2. **Test Integration** - Run full suite with running application
3. **Violation Analysis** - Review and document current accessibility issues

### Future
1. **Transition to Hard-Fail** - Change `failOnViolations` to `true`
2. **CI/CD Integration** - Add accessibility gates to build pipeline
3. **Performance Optimization** - Parallel test execution and caching

## Technical Details

### axe-core Rules Enabled
- **Critical**: color-contrast, document-title, html-has-lang, landmark-one-main
- **Important**: label, button-name, link-name, input-image-alt
- **Advisory**: heading-order, list, listitem, region, skip-link

### Browser Support
- Chromium (Chrome/Edge)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)

### Test Parallelization
- 6 workers for faster execution
- Multi-browser parallel testing
- HTML reporter for detailed results

## Compliance Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 Level A** - Basic accessibility requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** - Enhanced accessibility standards
- **Section 508** - Federal accessibility requirements (covered by WCAG)

## Documentation

- `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_TESTING.md` - User guide and troubleshooting
- `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This implementation summary
- Inline code documentation and comments

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Automated accessibility testing framework implemented
- ✅ Advisory mode reporting without test failures
- ✅ Multi-browser support across major engines
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for critical screens
- ✅ Keyboard navigation and form accessibility testing
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 compliance checking
- ✅ HTML reporting for CI/CD integration

The accessibility testing implementation is **complete and ready for use** once the dev server compatibility issue is resolved. The system provides a solid foundation for maintaining and improving accessibility standards across the application.
