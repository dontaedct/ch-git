## 2025-08-25 - OSS Hero Hardening Step 5: Single Source of Truth for Feature Flags (Supabase)

**What**: Implemented centralized feature flag management system with Supabase backend, replacing file-based and ad-hoc flag sources

**Why**: Consolidate feature flag management into a single, tenant-aware system with proper access controls and caching

**Scope**: 
- Created `feature_flags` table with tenant-based RLS policies and admin access controls
- Implemented `lib/flags/server.ts` with in-memory caching, edge-safe fetchers, and comprehensive flag management
- Built admin UI at `/app/operability/flags` for per-tenant flag management with real-time toggles
- Added API endpoints `/api/admin/flags` for programmatic flag management
- Created migration script `scripts/migrate-flags.ts` to move existing file-based flags to Supabase
- Updated `lib/supabase/types.ts` with FeatureFlag types and database schema
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/hardening/STEP5_FLAGS.md`
- Deprecated file-based flags in `lib/registry/flags.ts` with migration notices

**Migration**: 
- Run database migration `supabase/migrations/20250825_feature_flags.sql` to create feature_flags table
- Execute `npx tsx scripts/migrate-flags.ts` to migrate existing flags to Supabase
- Update code to use `lib/flags/server.ts` instead of file-based flag access
- Configure admin users with `role: 'admin'` in user metadata for flag management access

**Impact**: 
- All feature flags now managed centrally in Supabase with tenant isolation
- 5-minute in-memory caching for performance with automatic invalidation
- Admin UI for real-time flag management without code deployments
- Edge-safe flag access for serverless environments
- Comprehensive RLS policies ensuring tenant data isolation
- Zero breaking changes for existing flag consumers (graceful fallback)

## 2025-08-25 - OSS Hero Hardening Step 4: Webhook Security Spine (HMAC + Idempotency)

**What**: Implemented comprehensive webhook security infrastructure with HMAC signature verification and idempotency protection

**Why**: Prevent webhook replay attacks, ensure message integrity, and provide uniform security across all webhook endpoints

**Scope**: 
- Created `lib/webhooks/verifyHmac.ts` for constant-time SHA-256 HMAC signature verification
- Implemented `lib/webhooks/idempotency.ts` with event deduplication and automatic cleanup
- Built `lib/webhooks/index.ts` with uniform security wrappers (`withVerifiedWebhook`, `withStripeWebhook`, etc.)
- Added example webhook routes: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` and `app/api/webhooks/generic/route.ts`
- Created database migration `supabase/migrations/20250825_webhook_idempotency.sql` for idempotency tracking
- Implemented comprehensive test suite: `tests/webhooks/` with unit, integration, and security tests
- Added documentation in `docs/hardening/STEP4_WEBHOOKS.md` covering security headers, HMAC schemes, and test strategy

**Migration**: 
- Run database migration to create `webhook_idempotency` table
- Set webhook secret environment variables (e.g., `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- Wrap existing webhook handlers with security functions
- Update webhook provider configurations to use new security headers

**Impact**: 
- All webhook endpoints now have HMAC signature verification with timing attack protection
- Automatic replay attack prevention through idempotency tracking
- Stripe-specific verification with timestamp validation (5-minute window)
- Configurable security for different webhook providers
- Comprehensive test coverage for security scenarios
- Zero breaking changes for properly configured webhook secrets

## 2025-08-25 - OSS Hero Hardening Step 3: Environment Completeness & Fail-Fast Configuration

**What**: Implemented comprehensive environment variable management with fail-fast validation and secret hygiene

**Why**: Ensure critical configuration is present and properly scoped before application starts, prevent hardcoded secrets

**Scope**: 
- Created complete `env.example` with all operational environment variables and documentation
- Implemented `lib/config/requireEnv.ts` for fail-fast environment validation at boot
- Added CI environment validation script `scripts/check-env.ts` with dummy placeholders
- Created security secrets scanner `scripts/security-secrets.ts` to detect hardcoded secrets
- Integrated environment validation into `next.config.ts` for early boot validation
- Added npm scripts: `check:env` and `security:secrets`
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/hardening/STEP3_ENV.md`

**Migration**: 
- Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your actual values
- Run `npm run check:env` to validate environment configuration
- Run `npm run security:secrets` to scan for hardcoded secrets
- Update CI/CD to include environment validation steps

**Impact**: 
- Application will fail to start with missing critical environment variables
- Automated detection of hardcoded secrets and security issues
- Proper environment variable scoping (server vs client)
- CI-safe validation with dummy placeholders
- Zero breaking changes for properly configured environments

## 2025-08-25 - OSS Hero Hardening Step 2: TypeScript Strictness & Build-Time TS Checks

**What**: Implemented TypeScript strictness ratchet and build-time type checking enforcement

**Why**: Establish strict type safety without breaking existing functionality, enabling systematic type hardening

**Scope**: 
- Re-enabled build-time TypeScript enforcement in `next.config.ts`
- Ratcheted TS strictness with `noImplicitAny: true` and `strict: true`
- Disabled `allowJs` in main codebase, created separate `tsconfig.scripts.json`
- Added comprehensive ESLint rules preventing `any` usage (with exceptions)
- Enhanced pre-commit hooks with zero-warnings policy
- Added weekly CI job for comprehensive type checking (`skipLibCheck: false`)
- Created `tsconfig.scripts.json` for legacy script compatibility

**Migration**: 
- Existing code with implicit `any` types will now show TypeScript errors
- JavaScript files in main codebase need conversion to TypeScript
- AI-related files and scripts have relaxed rules to maintain compatibility

**Impact**: 
- Build failures on TypeScript errors (previously ignored)
- Stricter type checking in development and CI
- Pre-commit hooks now enforce type safety
- Zero breaking changes for AI and script files

## 2025-08-25 - OSS Hero Hardening Step 1: Baseline Health & Safety Gates

**What**: Established baseline health and safety gates for OSS Hero hardening process

**Why**: Create foundation for systematic hardening improvements across 14 steps

**Scope**: 
- Repository health inventory and baseline documentation
- Fixed picocolors import issue in doctor script
- Installed missing dependencies (resend, @playwright/test)
- Created comprehensive baseline reports and hardening scaffold

**Migration**: No migration required - this is baseline establishment only

**Impact**: Zero breaking changes, enables systematic hardening process

## 2025-01-13 - System Strings Registry Addition

**What**: Added new `lib/registry/strings.ts` file to centralize all system names and brand references

**Why**: Enable future system-wide rename capability by centralizing all user-facing text and system names

**Scope**: 
- New registry file with system strings
- Helper functions for validation and retrieval
- Export added to main registry index

**Migration**: No migration required - this is additive only

**Impact**: Zero breaking changes, enables future rename infrastructure
