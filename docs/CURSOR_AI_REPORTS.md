## Doctor Script Implementation Issues (2024-12-19)

### Task Summary
Successfully implemented a TypeScript doctor script that detects drift and suggests rename commands, but encountered several technical challenges that caused repeated freezing.

### Issues Encountered

#### 1. **Processing Overload Freezing**
- **Problem**: Script found 210+ TypeScript errors, causing AI to freeze when trying to process all at once
- **Root Cause**: Attempting to analyze and suggest fixes for too many errors simultaneously
- **Impact**: Repeated freezing during error processing and CI verification steps

#### 2. **ts-morph API Complexity**
- **Problem**: Initial implementation used incorrect `getLineAndCharacterAt` method
- **Solution**: Switched to `ts.getLineAndCharacterOfPosition(file.compilerNode, startPos)`
- **Lesson**: ts-morph API requires careful handling of compiler node access

#### 3. **Export Index Building Errors**
- **Problem**: Script encountered `[object Object]` errors during exports index construction
- **Root Cause**: Type mismatches and undefined declarations in export processing
- **Solution**: Added try-catch blocks and explicit type conversion with `String(name)`

#### 4. **Memory/Performance Issues**
- **Problem**: Building exports index across entire codebase caused memory pressure
- **Impact**: Script would hang during large-scale analysis
- **Mitigation**: Added file filtering and error handling for problematic files

### Technical Lessons Learned

1. **Chunked Processing**: Large error sets should be processed in smaller batches
2. **Error Isolation**: Individual error processing should be isolated to prevent cascading failures
3. **API Validation**: ts-morph APIs require careful validation of object types and null checks
4. **Memory Management**: Large-scale code analysis needs memory-conscious implementation

### Recommendations for Future AI Tasks

1. **Implement Progress Indicators**: Show processing progress for long-running operations
2. **Add Error Batching**: Process errors in configurable batch sizes
3. **Include Timeout Handling**: Add timeouts to prevent indefinite hanging
4. **Implement Fallback Modes**: Provide simplified analysis when full analysis fails

### Current Status
- ✅ Doctor script functional and detecting errors
- ✅ Rename suggestions working for module/export errors
- ✅ Auto-fix capability implemented
- ⚠️ Performance issues with large error sets
- ⚠️ Memory pressure during full codebase analysis

### Next Steps
1. Optimize exports index building for large codebases
2. Implement progressive error processing
3. Add performance monitoring and timeouts
4. Consider caching strategies for repeated analysis
