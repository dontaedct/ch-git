## Data Sources

The report reads from `.cache/design-safety/` directory, which is populated by the GitHub Actions workflow:

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/design-safety.yml`
- **Artifacts**: `design-safety-summaries` (30-day retention)
- **Cache Location**: `.cache/design-safety/` (committed to PR branches when possible)

## Testing

### Create Test Data
```bash
npm run test:design-report
```

### Clean Up Test Data

npm run test:design-report:cleanup
```

4. Uploads as GitHub artifacts
5. Commits cache to PR branches (when permitted)
