## 🧠 **1. AI-POWERED MEMORY LEAK DETECTOR & AUTO-RECOVERY**

### **What It Does**
- **Automatically scans** your entire codebase for memory leak patterns
- **Detects** event listener leaks, timeout leaks, subscription leaks, and closure issues
- **Auto-fixes** common memory leak patterns where possible
- **Provides real-time** memory health dashboard
- **Integrates** with existing guardian and doctor systems

### **Key Features**
- **Intelligent Pattern Recognition**: Uses AST analysis to find memory leak patterns
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically fixes common issues like missing useEffect cleanup
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage across components and hooks
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed memory health reports

### **Usage**
```bash
# Detect memory leaks
npm run memory:detect

# Auto-fix memory leaks
npm run memory:fix

# Generate memory health report
npm run memory:report
```

### **What It Fixes**
- ✅ Missing `useEffect` cleanup functions
- ✅ Event listeners without `removeEventListener`
- ✅ Timeouts/intervals without `clearTimeout`/`clearInterval`
- ✅ Subscriptions without `unsubscribe`
- ✅ Orphaned closures and references

### **Example Output**
```
🧠 AI-POWERED MEMORY LEAK DETECTOR STARTING

## 🚨 **2. UNIVERSAL HEADER COMPLIANCE AUTO-ENFORCER**

### **What It Does**
- **Automatically enforces** universal header compliance across your entire codebase
- **Auto-adds** `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to routes that spawn processes
- **Enforces** import alias compliance in real-time
- **Auto-fixes** accessibility violations (clickable divs → buttons)
- **Provides instant feedback** during development

### **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Enforcement**: Continuously monitors and enforces compliance
- **Automatic Fixes**: Fixes common violations without manual intervention
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers runtime, imports, accessibility, secrets, and RLS
- **Compliance Scoring**: Provides real-time compliance score (0-100)

### **Usage**
```bash
# Enforce universal header compliance
npm run compliance:enforce

# Auto-fix compliance violations
npm run compliance:fix

# Generate compliance report
npm run compliance:report
```

### **What It Enforces**
- ✅ **Runtime Compliance**: Auto-adds `runtime = 'nodejs'` where needed
- ✅ **Import Aliases**: Enforces `@app/*`, `@data/*`, `@lib/*`, `@ui/*` patterns
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Prevents clickable `<div>` and `<span>` elements
- ✅ **Secret Security**: Detects potential secret exposure
- ✅ **RLS Compliance**: Ensures proper Row Level Security patterns

### **Example Output**
```
🚨 UNIVERSAL HEADER COMPLIANCE AUTO-ENFORCER STARTING
===============================================
🔍 Scanning for compliance violations...
📁 Scanning 67 source files for compliance...
🧠 Analyzing compliance violations...
📊 Found 12 compliance violations:
  🚨 Runtime Missing: 3

  ♿ Accessibility: 2
  🔐 Secret Exposure: 1
  🛡️ RLS Violations: 1
  🚨 Critical Issues: 4
  📊 Compliance Score: 76/100
🔧 Auto-fixing compliance violations...
✅ Auto-fixed 8/12 violations
✅ UNIVERSAL HEADER COMPLIANCE ENFORCED
🎯 All rules automatically enforced across codebase
```
