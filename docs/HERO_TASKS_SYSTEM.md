## Task Numbering System

### Format: `HT-{MAIN}.{SUB}.{ACTION}`

- **HT**: Hero Task prefix
- **MAIN**: Main task number (001, 002, 003...)
- **SUB**: Subtask number (1, 2, 3...)
- **ACTION**: Action number (1, 2, 3...)

### Examples:
- `HT-001` - Main task: "Implement User Authentication"
- `HT-001.1` - Subtask: "Design authentication schema"
- `HT-001.1.1` - Action: "Create user table migration"
- `HT-001.1.2` - Action: "Add password hashing logic"

## Task Types

### Primary Types
- **Feature** - New functionality implementation
- **Bug Fix** - Error resolution and fixes
- **Refactor** - Code improvement without behavior change
- **Documentation** - Documentation creation/updates
- **Test** - Test implementation/updates
- **Security** - Security-related tasks
- **Performance** - Performance optimization
- **Integration** - Third-party service integration
- **Migration** - Data/system migration
- **Maintenance** - Routine maintenance tasks

### Secondary Types
- **Research** - Investigation and analysis
- **Planning** - Task planning and design
- **Review** - Code/documentation review
- **Deployment** - Release and deployment tasks
- **Monitoring** - Observability and monitoring setup

## Priority Levels

1. **Critical** - System-breaking issues, security vulnerabilities
2. **High** - Important features, significant bugs
3. **Medium** - Standard features, minor bugs
4. **Low** - Nice-to-have features, cosmetic issues

## Status Workflow

```
Draft → Ready → In Progress → [Blocked] → Completed
  ↓        ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓
Cancelled ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
```

### Status Definitions
- **Draft** - Task is being defined and planned
- **Ready** - Task is ready to start (all dependencies met)
- **In Progress** - Task is actively being worked on
- **Blocked** - Task cannot proceed due to external dependencies
- **Completed** - Task is finished and verified
- **Cancelled** - Task is no longer needed

## Tags System

### Technical Tags
- `frontend` - Frontend-related tasks
- `backend` - Backend-related tasks
- `database` - Database-related tasks
- `api` - API-related tasks
- `ui` - User interface tasks
- `ux` - User experience tasks
- `mobile` - Mobile-specific tasks
- `desktop` - Desktop-specific tasks

### Domain Tags
- `authentication` - Authentication and authorization
- `payment` - Payment processing
- `notification` - Notification systems
- `analytics` - Analytics and reporting
- `security` - Security-related tasks
- `performance` - Performance optimization
- `accessibility` - Accessibility improvements
- `internationalization` - i18n/l10n tasks

### Process Tags
- `urgent` - Requires immediate attention
- `breaking-change` - Will cause breaking changes
- `deprecated` - Related to deprecation
- `experimental` - Experimental features
- `hotfix` - Critical hotfix
- `release` - Release-related tasks

## Workflow Integration

### Audit-Decide-Apply-Verify Process

Each task follows the established workflow:

1. **AUDIT** - Analyze current state and requirements
2. **DECIDE** - Make decisions with documented reasoning
3. **APPLY** - Implement changes with minimal diffs
4. **VERIFY** - Validate implementation with tests and checks

### Automated Workflow Triggers

- **Task Creation** → Auto-generate audit checklist
- **Task Start** → Begin audit phase
- **Audit Complete** → Move to decide phase
- **Decision Made** → Move to apply phase
- **Implementation Complete** → Move to verify phase
- **Verification Passed** → Mark task complete

## Date Management

### Required Dates
- **Created** - When task was first created
- **Updated** - Last modification timestamp
- **Started** - When work began (if applicable)
- **Completed** - When task was finished (if applicable)

### Optional Dates
- **Due Date** - Target completion date
- **Estimated Duration** - Expected time to complete
- **Actual Duration** - Time actually spent

### Date Validation
- All dates are stored in ISO 8601 format
- Dates are automatically validated on creation/update
- Timezone information is preserved
- Date changes trigger audit trail updates

## AI Optimization
