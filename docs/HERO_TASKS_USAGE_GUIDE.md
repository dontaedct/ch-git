**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: Complete  

## Overview

The Hero Tasks system is a comprehensive, industry-tiered task management solution designed to manage every aspect of development work through a structured, AI-optimized, and human-readable interface. It integrates seamlessly with the existing audit-decide-apply-verify workflow and provides detailed tracking, organization, and automation capabilities.

## Quick Start

### 1. Access the Hero Tasks System

Navigate to `/hero-tasks` in your application to access the main dashboard.

### 2. Create Your First Task

1. Click "New Task" on the dashboard
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Title**: Descriptive task name
   - **Type**: Select from available task types
   - **Priority**: Choose appropriate priority level
3. Add optional details like description, assignee, due date, and tags
4. Click "Create Task"

### 3. Manage Task Workflow

Each task automatically follows the audit-decide-apply-verify workflow:
- **Audit**: Analyze current state and requirements
- **Decide**: Make decisions with documented reasoning
- **Apply**: Implement changes with minimal diffs
- **Verify**: Validate implementation with tests and checks

## Task Numbering System

### Format: `HT-{MAIN}.{SUB}.{ACTION}`

- **HT**: Hero Task prefix
- **MAIN**: Main task number (001, 002, 003...)
- **SUB**: Subtask number (1, 2, 3...)
- **ACTION**: Action number (1, 2, 3...)

### Examples:
- `HT-001` - Main task: "Implement User Authentication"
- `HT-001.1` - Subtask: "Design authentication schema"
- `HT-001.1.1` - Action: "Create user table migration"
- `HT-001.1.2` - Action: "Add password hashing logic"

## Task Types

### Primary Types
- **Feature** - New functionality implementation
- **Bug Fix** - Error resolution and fixes
- **Refactor** - Code improvement without behavior change
- **Documentation** - Documentation creation/updates
- **Test** - Test implementation/updates
- **Security** - Security-related tasks
- **Performance** - Performance optimization
- **Integration** - Third-party service integration
- **Migration** - Data/system migration
- **Maintenance** - Routine maintenance tasks

### Secondary Types
- **Research** - Investigation and analysis
- **Planning** - Task planning and design
- **Review** - Code/documentation review
- **Deployment** - Release and deployment tasks
- **Monitoring** - Observability and monitoring setup

## Priority Levels

1. **Critical** - System-breaking issues, security vulnerabilities
2. **High** - Important features, significant bugs
3. **Medium** - Standard features, minor bugs
4. **Low** - Nice-to-have features, cosmetic issues

## Status Workflow

```
Draft → Ready → In Progress → [Blocked] → Completed
  ↓        ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓
Cancelled ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
```

### Status Definitions
- **Draft** - Task is being defined and planned
- **Ready** - Task is ready to start (all dependencies met)
- **In Progress** - Task is actively being worked on
- **Blocked** - Task cannot proceed due to external dependencies
- **Completed** - Task is finished and verified
- **Cancelled** - Task is no longer needed

## Workflow Integration

### Audit-Decide-Apply-Verify Process

Each task automatically follows the established workflow:

1. **AUDIT** - Analyze current state and requirements
   - Review current system state
   - Identify requirements and constraints
   - Document current issues and risks
   - Gather necessary information and context
   - Validate scope and boundaries

2. **DECIDE** - Make decisions with documented reasoning
   - Evaluate available options
   - Consider trade-offs and implications
   - Document decision rationale
   - Get stakeholder approval if needed
   - Finalize approach and plan

3. **APPLY** - Implement changes with minimal diffs
   - Implement core changes
   - Follow coding standards and best practices
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation
   - Ensure backward compatibility

4. **VERIFY** - Validate implementation with tests and checks
   - Run automated tests
   - Perform manual testing
   - Validate against requirements
   - Check performance and security
   - Get final approval

### Automated Workflow Triggers

- **Task Creation** → Auto-generate audit checklist
- **Task Start** → Begin audit phase
- **Audit Complete** → Move to decide phase
- **Decision Made** → Move to apply phase
- **Implementation Complete** → Move to verify phase
- **Verification Passed** → Mark task complete

## Tags System

### Technical Tags
- `frontend` - Frontend-related tasks
- `backend` - Backend-related tasks
- `database` - Database-related tasks
- `api` - API-related tasks
- `ui` - User interface tasks
- `ux` - User experience tasks
- `mobile` - Mobile-specific tasks
- `desktop` - Desktop-specific tasks

### Domain Tags
- `authentication` - Authentication and authorization
- `payment` - Payment processing
- `notification` - Notification systems
- `analytics` - Analytics and reporting
- `security` - Security-related tasks
- `performance` - Performance optimization
- `accessibility` - Accessibility improvements
- `internationalization` - i18n/l10n tasks

### Process Tags
- `urgent` - Requires immediate attention
- `breaking-change` - Will cause breaking changes
- `deprecated` - Related to deprecation
- `experimental` - Experimental features
- `hotfix` - Critical hotfix
- `release` - Release-related tasks

## Date Management

### Required Dates
- **Created** - When task was first created (automatic)
- **Updated** - Last modification timestamp (automatic)
- **Started** - When work began (automatic when status changes to "In Progress")
- **Completed** - When task was finished (automatic when status changes to "Completed")

### Optional Dates
- **Due Date** - Target completion date (user-defined)
- **Estimated Duration** - Expected time to complete (user-defined)
- **Actual Duration** - Time actually spent (user-defined)

### Date Validation
- All dates are stored in ISO 8601 format
- Dates are automatically validated on creation/update
- Timezone information is preserved
- Date changes trigger audit trail updates

## Subtasks and Actions

### Subtasks
Subtasks break down main tasks into manageable components:
- Each subtask has its own status, priority, and workflow
- Subtasks can have dependencies on other subtasks
- Subtasks can have their own assignees and due dates

### Actions
Actions are the smallest unit of work within subtasks:
- Actions represent specific, actionable steps
- Actions can be completed independently
- Actions track detailed progress and time

## Dependencies

### Dependency Types
- **Blocks** - Task A must be completed before Task B can start
- **Relates To** - Tasks are related but not blocking
- **Conflicts With** - Tasks cannot be worked on simultaneously

### Managing Dependencies
1. Create tasks first
2. Use the dependency management interface
3. Set dependency types appropriately
4. Monitor dependency resolution

## Attachments and Comments

### Attachments
- **Files** - Upload documents, images, or code files
- **Links** - Reference external resources
- **Screenshots** - Visual documentation
- **Documents** - Formal documentation

### Comments
- **Comment** - General discussion
- **Decision** - Documented decisions
