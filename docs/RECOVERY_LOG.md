# Recovery Log - White Screen Regression Fix

## Incident Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Issue**: Recurring "white screen after <1s" regression after AI integration  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

## Root Cause (FINAL CORRECTED)
The issue was **NOT** a missing dependency or file system operations. The real root cause was:

**CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY**: The AI module had a circular import that crashed the module system:

```typescript
// lib/ai/index.ts - Line 6
import { routeRequest } from './router';

// lib/ai/router.ts - Line 6  
import { AIOptions, AIResult } from './index';
```

This created an infinite import loop that prevented the module from loading, causing the white screen.

## Exact Files/Lines Affected
- **Primary**: `lib/ai/index.ts:6` - Import from `./router`
- **Primary**: `lib/ai/router.ts:6` - Import from `./index` 
- **Secondary**: All AI module files that depended on this circular import

## Fix Applied
1. **Broke circular dependency**: Created `lib/ai/types.ts` with centralized type definitions
2. **Updated imports**: Changed all files to import types from `./types` instead of `./index`
3. **Used type-only imports**: Used `import type` to prevent runtime circular dependencies
4. **Centralized interfaces**: Moved `AITask`, `AIOptions`, and `AIResult` to types file

## Why It Can't Regress
- **No circular imports**: Types are imported from a dedicated types file
- **Type-only imports**: `import type` prevents runtime circular dependencies
- **Centralized definitions**: All types are defined in one place
- **Clean dependency graph**: Linear import chain: types → index → router → providers

## Verification
- ✅ AI module compiles without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Dev server starts successfully on port 3002
- ✅ No white screen on app startup
- ✅ Circular dependency completely resolved

## Prevention Measures
- Never import from `./index` in files that `./index` imports from
- Use `import type` for interface/type imports
- Centralize shared types in dedicated files
- Maintain clean, linear dependency graphs

## Notes
The fix preserves all security (RLS, env secrets) and follows universal header conventions. The critical insight was that the issue was a **circular dependency in the module system**, which is a common but subtle cause of white screen crashes in Next.js applications. The solution pattern is to break circular dependencies by centralizing shared types and using type-only imports.
