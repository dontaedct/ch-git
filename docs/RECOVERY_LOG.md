# Recovery Log

## 2025-08-16 - Normal Mode Restoration

**Objective**: Prove normal mode works and lock the change in.

**Scope**: .env.local, package.json (scripts), CI.

**AUDIT Results**:
✅ Environment flags properly set:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=0
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SAFE_MODE=0

✅ Pre-push hook confirmed:
- Runs doctor + lint + tests + build
- Properly configured in package.json

**DECIDE**:
- ✅ SAFE_MODE and DEBUG are off in production build
- ✅ /debug/bulletproof route available only when DEBUG=1
- ✅ No-leak guard script prevents debug/safe mode leaks

**APPLY**:
- ✅ Fixed import compliance violations in app/layout.tsx
- ✅ Removed debug imports from root layout
- ✅ Moved debug functionality to /debug/bulletproof route only
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured

**VERIFY**:
- ✅ Doctor passes with no import compliance violations
- ✅ Core application structure intact
- ✅ Debug route properly gated behind DEBUG=1

**Status**: Normal mode restored and locked in. Debug functionality moved to appropriate route with proper environment gating.
