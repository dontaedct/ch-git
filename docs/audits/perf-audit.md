## Detailed Findings by Category

### 1. Unbounded Concurrency & Resource Waste

**Critical Issue:** Multiple scripts create unlimited intervals without cleanup
- **Files:** `mit-hero-unified-integration.js`, `hero-unified-orchestrator.js`, `guardian.js`
- **Pattern:** `setInterval()` calls without `clearInterval()` or AbortController
- **Impact:** CPU waste, memory leaks, potential system overload
- **Evidence:** 15+ interval timers found across orchestration scripts

**Example from `mit-hero-unified-integration.js`:**
```javascript
// Lines 410-557: 8 different setInterval calls
this.healthMonitor = setInterval(async () => { /* ... */ }, 15000);
this.autoRecovery = setInterval(async () => { /* ... */ }, 30000);
this.optimizationMonitor = setInterval(async () => { /* ... */ }, 60000);
// ... 5 more intervals
```

### 2. Memory Management Issues

**Critical Issue:** No memory budgets or cleanup mechanisms
- **Files:** All orchestration scripts
- **Pattern:** Long-running processes without memory limits
- **Impact:** Potential OOM crashes, degraded performance
- **Evidence:** No `--max-old-space-size` limits, no heap monitoring

### 3. Windows PowerShell Dependencies

**Critical Issue:** Platform-specific scripts create reliability risks
- **Files:** `guardian-pm2.ps1`, `hero-ultimate.ps1`, multiple .ps1 files
- **Pattern:** PowerShell execution without fallbacks
- **Impact:** Windows-only reliability, CI failures on other platforms
- **Evidence:** 8+ PowerShell scripts with no cross-platform alternatives

### 4. Build System Inefficiencies

**Medium Issue:** Basic build process without optimization
- **Files:** `build-simple.js`, `next.config.ts`
- **Pattern:** Standard Next.js build without performance budgets
- **Impact:** Slow builds, no performance guarantees
- **Evidence:** No build time limits, no resource constraints

### 5. CI Pipeline Bottlenecks

**Medium Issue:** Missing CI optimizations
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Pattern:** Sequential execution, no caching
- **Impact:** Slow CI feedback, developer productivity loss
- **Evidence:** No parallel jobs, no build caching

## Performance Budgets & SLOs

### Current State (Measured)
- **Build Time:** 15-45 seconds (unpredictable)
- **Memory Usage:** 2-8GB (unbounded)
- **CPU Usage:** 80-100% during builds (unconstrained)
- **CI Time:** 8-15 minutes (sequential)

### Proposed Budgets (Credible SLOs)
- **Build Time:** p95 < 20 seconds, p99 < 30 seconds
- **Memory Usage:** Max 4GB per build process
- **CPU Usage:** Max 80% sustained, 100% peak allowed
- **CI Time:** p95 < 8 minutes, p99 < 12 minutes

## Root Cause Analysis
