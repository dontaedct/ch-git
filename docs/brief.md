# User Authentication Service Enhancement

## Overview
Enhance the existing user authentication service to support multi-factor authentication (MFA) and improve security posture.

## Requirements
- Implement TOTP-based MFA using Google Authenticator or similar apps
- Add rate limiting for login attempts
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Add audit logging for security events
- Support backup codes for account recovery

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing auth flows
- Should integrate with existing user management system
- Must follow OWASP security guidelines
- Performance impact should be <100ms for MFA verification

## Success Metrics
- 95% of users enable MFA within 30 days
- Zero successful brute force attacks
- <1% false positive rate for legitimate users
- 99.9% uptime for MFA verification service

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core MFA implementation (4 weeks)
- Phase 2: Rate limiting and lockout (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: Audit logging and monitoring (2 weeks)
- Phase 4: Testing and deployment (2 weeks)
