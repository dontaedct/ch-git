## ðŸ“Š Key Features Implemented

### Natural Language Task Creation
- **Input**: "Create a high priority bug fix for the login issue due tomorrow and assign it to John Smith"
- **Output**: Structured task with title, priority (HIGH), type (BUG_FIX), due date, assignee, and tags

### Entity Extraction
- **Dates**: "tomorrow", "next week", "12/25/2024", "Monday"
- **People**: "John Smith", "@username", "assign to Sarah"
- **Priorities**: "urgent", "high priority", "critical", "low"
- **Task Types**: "bug fix", "feature", "refactor", "documentation"
- **Tags**: "#frontend", "#mobile", "#api"
- **Durations**: "2 hours", "3 days", "1 week"

### Intent Recognition
- **Create**: "create", "add", "new", "make", "build"
- **Update**: "update", "modify", "change", "edit", "fix"
- **Search**: "find", "search", "show me", "list"
- **Assign**: "assign", "give to", "delegate"
- **Schedule**: "schedule", "plan", "due", "set up"
- **Prioritize**: "prioritize", "urgent", "important"

### Smart Suggestions
- **Missing Priority**: Suggest based on keywords and context
- **Task Type**: Infer from content analysis
- **Tags**: Generate relevant tags from content
- **Duration**: Estimate based on task complexity and type
