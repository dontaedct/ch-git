## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Files Created/Modified:**
- `components/EnhancedNavigation.tsx` - New enhanced navigation component
- `app/layout.tsx` - Updated to use enhanced navigation
- `styles/motion.css` - Added navigation-specific animations

### **Animation Variants Added:**
```typescript
const headerVariants = {
  hidden: { y: -100, opacity: 0 },
  visible: { 
    y: 0, 
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      duration: reducedMotion ? 0.01 : 0.4,
      ease: "easeOut"
    }
  }
}

const navItemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: -20 },
  visible: (i: number) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: reducedMotion ? 0.01 : 0.3,
      delay: reducedMotion ? 0 : i * 0.1,
      ease: "easeOut"
    }
  })
}
```

### **CSS Animations Added:**
```css
@keyframes navSlideIn {
  0% { transform: translateY(-100%); opacity: 0; }
  100% { transform: translateY(0); opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes mobileMenuSlide {
  0% { transform: translateX(100%); }
  100% { transform: translateX(0); }
}

@keyframes navHoverLift {
  0% { transform: translateY(0) scale(1); }
  100% { transform: translateY(-2px) scale(1.02); }
}
```
