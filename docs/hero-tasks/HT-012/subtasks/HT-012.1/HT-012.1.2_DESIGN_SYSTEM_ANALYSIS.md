# HT-012.1.2: Design System Analysis & Extension

**Phase:** HT-012.1 - Design Research & Foundation  
**Estimated Hours:** 1  
**Status:** Pending  
**Priority:** High  

---

## Objective

Audit current design system components and tokens, identify gaps for new design styles, and plan extensions needed for multi-style support.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Audit Existing Design System
- **Components**: Review all existing UI components and their variants
- **Tokens**: Analyze current design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
- **Architecture**: Understand current component structure and API patterns
- **Usage**: Document how components are currently used across the application

### 2. Identify Style Gaps
- **Color Palettes**: Identify missing color schemes for new styles
- **Typography**: Determine additional typography scales needed
- **Spacing**: Review spacing systems for different design approaches
- **Shadows**: Analyze shadow systems for various depth requirements
- **Borders**: Review border styles and radius variations

### 3. Plan Design Token Extensions
- **Color Tokens**: Define new color palettes for each design style
- **Typography Tokens**: Create typography scales for different styles
- **Spacing Tokens**: Plan spacing variations for different layouts
- **Shadow Tokens**: Define shadow systems for various depth levels
- **Border Tokens**: Create border variations for different styles

### 4. Component Extension Planning
- **Base Components**: Identify components that need style variants
- **Variant System**: Plan component variant architecture
- **API Design**: Design component API for style switching
- **Shared Components**: Identify components that work across all styles
