    "description": "MODULAR ADMIN INTERFACE TRANSFORMATION: Build upon HT-031's AI-powered foundation to create a revolutionary modular admin interface system that automatically expands with dynamic template-specific settings. This system transforms the agency-toolkit from an app generator into an intelligent platform that grows organically with each template addition.\n\n**Mission:** Create a foundational admin interface that automatically expands with dynamic template-specific settings whenever new page/feature templates are added. Like a smartphone's settings app - core system settings are always present, but when new templates are installed, their settings automatically appear in the same unified interface.\n\n**Scope:** Modular admin interface architecture, intelligent template registration system, dynamic settings management, AI-powered template recommendations, seamless integration with HT-031's AI systems, and comprehensive template marketplace infrastructure.\n\n**Methodology:** BUILD → INTEGRATE → OPTIMIZE → SCALE with 100+ verification checkpoints, comprehensive testing, and surgical integration with existing HT-031 systems without disruption.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n- Create revolutionary modular admin experience\n- Enable unlimited template extensibility\n- Provide intelligent template management and recommendations\n- Deliver seamless user experience across all templates\n- Implement AI-powered template discovery and optimization\n- Create template marketplace infrastructure\n- Establish market leadership in modular platform architecture",
