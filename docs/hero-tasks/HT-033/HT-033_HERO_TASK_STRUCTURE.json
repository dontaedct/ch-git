    "description": "HYBRID CLIENT TEMPLATE MANAGEMENT: Transform the agency-toolkit into a hybrid client template management system that enables rapid customization and deployment of branded micro-apps for SMB clients. This system leverages existing infrastructure while adding AI-powered customization, client-specific deployments, and centralized control.\n\n**Mission:** Create a hybrid architecture that maintains centralized control while enabling client-specific customizations and deployments. Transform from template generator to client app factory with AI-powered customization, automated deployment, and comprehensive client management.\n\n**Scope:** Template management system, AI-powered customization engine, client deployment pipeline, centralized control interface, automated handover system, and cross-client analytics - building on existing HT-031 AI systems and HT-032 modular admin interface.\n\n**Methodology:** AUDIT → DECIDE → APPLY → VERIFY with 120+ verification checkpoints, comprehensive testing, and surgical integration with existing systems without disruption.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n- Enable $50k-200k annual revenue with $2k-8k per client\n- Achieve ≤7-day delivery with AI-assisted customization\n- Provide centralized control over all client deployments\n- Create automated handover and client management\n- Establish scalable client app factory operations\n- Enable rapid template-to-custom-app transformation",
