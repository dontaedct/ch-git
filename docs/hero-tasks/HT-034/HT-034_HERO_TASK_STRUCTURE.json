This task addresses database schema conflicts, build failures, TypeScript errors, authentication fragmentation, and data flow inconsistencies to ensure the Hybrid Client Template Management system works perfectly together.\n\n**Mission:** Execute surgical repair of HT-033 integration conflicts through methodical audit-decide-apply-verify process. Unify fragmented systems, resolve build failures, fix TypeScript errors, consolidate authentication approaches, and establish proper data flow to achieve intended business transformation goals.\n\n**Scope:** Database schema unification, dependency resolution, TypeScript error fixes, authentication system consolidation, data layer standardization, UI/UX consistency enforcement, performance optimization, and comprehensive integration testing.\n\n**Methodology:** AUDIT → DECIDE → APPLY → VERIFY with mandatory review checkpoints and user consultation for major decisions. Each phase requires explicit approval before proceeding to prevent chaotic changes.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n- Restore $50k-200k annual revenue potential blocked by integration failures\n- Enable ≤7-day delivery capability through functional system integration\n- Eliminate security vulnerabilities from authentication conflicts\n- Establish reliable client app factory operations\n- Achieve 99.9% system reliability through proper integration",
