    "description": "PRD CORE COMPLIANCE IMPLEMENTATION: Complete the three critical missing systems required by the DCT Micro-Apps Product Requirements Document (Section 5, 7, 8, 18). Transform the agency toolkit from a template platform into a production-ready micro-app factory with automation orchestration, hot-pluggable modules, and professional client handover.\n\n**Mission:** Implement the final 50% of PRD requirements to achieve 100% compliance. Build the orchestration layer (n8n/Temporal integration), module hot-plugging system (zero-downtime activation), and client handover automation (SOPs, walkthroughs, access management) that enable ≤7-day delivery with professional quality.\n\n**Scope:** Automation orchestration connector, hot-pluggable module registry, module marketplace infrastructure, client handover automation system, workflow execution monitoring, module lifecycle management, and comprehensive client deliverables generation - all building on existing HT-031, HT-032, and HT-033 foundations.\n\n**Methodology:** AUDIT → DECIDE → APPLY → VERIFY with 160+ verification checkpoints, comprehensive PRD alignment validation, and surgical integration with zero disruption to existing systems.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n- Achieve 100% PRD compliance and production readiness\n- Enable true ≤7-day micro-app delivery with automation\n- Support $2k-8k pricing model with professional handover\n- Unlock module marketplace revenue stream ($200-2k per module)\n- Reduce manual work by 80% through automation orchestration\n- Achieve 95%+ client satisfaction with automated handover\n- Enable 10-20 micro-apps/month delivery capacity\n- Support $50k-200k annual revenue target with sustainable operations",
