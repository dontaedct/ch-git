## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### API Gateway Flow
```
Client Request → API Gateway → Route Matching → Auth Check → Rate Limit → Service Forwarding → Response
```

### Service Communication Flow
```
Service A → Communication Layer → Circuit Breaker → Retry Logic → Message Delivery → Service B
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Request → Auth Integration → Token/Session Validation → Permission Check → Auth Context → Handler
```

### Middleware Pipeline
```
Request → Logging → Auth → Handler → Metrics → Error Handling → Response Enhancement → Client
```
