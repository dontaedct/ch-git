# MIT Hero System - Historical Archive

## Overview
This directory contains the historical documentation and scripts from the MIT Hero system that was previously used in this project.

## What Was MIT Hero?
MIT Hero was a comprehensive development automation and safety system that included:
- System health monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Validation and testing automation
- Safety gates and security checks
- Development workflow automation

## Why Archived?
The MIT Hero system was archived because:
1. **System Issues**: Had infinite loops, freezing, and performance problems
2. **Complexity**: Became overly complex and difficult to maintain
3. **Replacement**: Replaced with more standard, reliable tooling
4. **Evolution**: Project evolved to use modern development practices

## Current Status
- **NOT IN USE**: These files are historical only
- **REPLACED BY**: Standard npm scripts, doctor system, and modern tooling
- **REFERENCE ONLY**: Kept for historical reference and learning
