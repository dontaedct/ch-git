# DCT Micro‑Apps — CursorAI Prompt Suite v2.0 Enhanced (Strategic Phased Implementation)

> **How to use**: This suite uses a **strategic phased approach** instead of 36 separate branches. Each phase groups related prompts into cohesive, testable increments. Follow the phases sequentially: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6. Every prompt is self‑contained with context, hard rules, explicit deliverables, and verification. Our operating loop is **Audit → Decide → Apply → Verify → Repeat**. Let Cursor be creative in implementation details, but never drift from the goal.

## **STRATEGIC PHASED APPROACH - WHY THIS IS SUPERIOR**

### **The Problem with 36 Separate Branches:**

- **Branch Explosion**: 36 branches = 36 PRs = massive review overhead
- **Context Switching**: Each prompt loses context from previous work
- **Merge Conflicts**: Cascading conflicts as branches diverge
- **Testing Complexity**: Hard to test cumulative changes
- **Rollback Nightmare**: If something breaks, which branch caused it?

### **The Solution - Strategic Phased Implementation:**

- **Logical Grouping**: Related changes stay together
- **Testable Increments**: Each phase can be tested end-to-end
- **Easier Rollbacks**: If phase 3 breaks, you know exactly where
- **Better Reviews**: Reviewers see cohesive changes, not scattered commits
- **Continuous Integration**: All changes flow together logically

## **PHASE STRUCTURE**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure** (Prompts 01-06)

- **Branch**: `ops/phase-1-foundation`
- **Goal**: Solid foundation for everything else
- **Focus**: Baseline, environment, diagnostics, CLI, CI/CD, automation
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready foundation with CI/CD

### **Phase 2: Security & Observability** (Prompts 07-12)

- **Branch**: `ops/phase-2-security-observability`
- **Goal**: Production-grade security and monitoring
- **Focus**: Security headers, scans, OpenTelemetry, health, SLOs, performance
- **Deliverable**: Enterprise-grade security and observability

### **Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance** (Prompts 13-17)

- **Branch**: `ops/phase-3-testing-quality`
- **Goal**: Quality that enforces itself
- **Focus**: Accessibility, testing pyramid, contract tests, error handling, privacy
- **Deliverable**: Comprehensive testing and quality assurance

### **Phase 4: Modular Architecture & Blocks** (Prompts 18-25)

- **Branch**: `ops/phase-4-blocks-extraction`
- **Goal**: Modular, reusable architecture
- **Focus**: Extract reusable components into packages, build blocks
- **Deliverable**: Modular, reusable component system

### **Phase 5: Presets & Business Logic** (Prompts 26-30)

- **Branch**: `ops/phase-5-presets-integration`
- **Goal**: Vertical-specific implementations
- **Focus**: RBAC, vertical presets, business workflows, documentation
- **Deliverable**: Business-ready vertical implementations

### **Phase 6: Production Readiness & Polish** (Prompts 31-36)

- **Branch**: `ops/phase-6-final-polish`
- **Goal**: Production-ready delivery
- **Focus**: Release tooling, monorepo optimization, validation, delivery
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready template

## **EXECUTION STRATEGY**

### **Phase-by-Phase Workflow:**

1. **Start Phase 1**: Get the foundation rock-solid
2. **Complete & Test**: Run full validation before moving to next phase
3. **Merge & Tag**: Create PR, merge to main, tag for reference
4. **Document Progress**: Keep phase completion checklist
5. **Iterate**: Use feedback to adjust remaining phases

### **Branch Management:**

- Each phase gets ONE branch
- All prompts in that phase commit to the same branch
- Phase completion = PR creation and merge
- Clear tagging for reference and rollback

### **Quality Gates:**

- Each phase must pass all tests before proceeding
- End-to-end validation at phase completion
- Integration testing with previous phases
- Performance and security validation

## **ENHANCEMENTS FROM V1.0**

### **Improved Best Practices:**

- **Environment Security**: Encryption, rotation detection, security levels
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket updates, live health scoring
- **Business Metrics**: KPIs alongside technical metrics
- **Advanced Security**: Bot detection, IP reputation, security event logging
- **Compliance**: Automated compliance reporting, policy enforcement
- **Performance**: Regression detection, bottleneck identification
- **Testing**: Contract tests, accessibility automation, comprehensive coverage

### **Strategic Improvements:**

- **Phased Implementation**: Eliminates branch chaos
- **Continuous Integration**: Better testing and validation
- **Risk Management**: Contained risk within phases
- **Team Coordination**: Easier assignment and collaboration
- **Client Delivery**: Can ship completed phases while working on others

## **IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **For Each Phase:**

1. **Audit First**: Understand current state and gaps
2. **Decide Strategically**: Choose best approach with tradeoffs
3. **Apply Incrementally**: Small, testable commits
4. **Verify Thoroughly**: Test everything before phase completion
5. **Document Everything**: ADRs, implementation notes, lessons learned

### **Success Metrics:**

- **Phase Completion Time**: Target 1-2 weeks per phase
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% throughout
- **Performance**: No regression from previous phases
- **Security**: All security checks pass
- **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date

## **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Review Phase 1**: Start with foundation implementation
2. **Plan Phase 2**: Prepare for security and observability
3. **Team Alignment**: Ensure everyone understands the phased approach
4. **Tooling Setup**: Prepare CI/CD and testing infrastructure
5. **Documentation**: Create phase completion checklists

This strategic phased approach transforms a potentially chaotic 36-branch implementation into a structured, manageable, and successful transformation journey.
