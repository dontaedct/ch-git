# Archive: Template Development History

**Archive Date**: 2025-08-31T05:51:43Z  
**Archive Reason**: Final template cleanup before client deployment

## Contents

This archive contains development methodology documentation created during the template's 36-prompt development cycle (SOS process). These files document the development process but are not needed for template operation.

### Archived Files

- **`SOS_JOB_PHASES.md`** - Complete documentation of the 36-prompt SOS development methodology
- **`SOS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Quick reference guide for the SOS process
- **`DCT_MICRO_APPS_CURSOR_AI_PROMPT_SUITE_V2_ENHANCED.md`** - Enhanced development prompt suite documentation
- **`DCT_MICRO_APPS_PROMPT_SUITE_V2_OVERVIEW.md`** - Overview of the prompt suite methodology

### Why Archived

These documents served their purpose during development but:

- Are not needed for template functionality
- Add noise to the repository for end users
- Document internal development processes rather than user-facing features
- Have historical value that should be preserved

### Restoration

To restore any of these files to the repository root:

```bash
git mv docs/ops/_archive/2025-08-31T05-51-43Z/[filename] .
```

### Template Status

The template remains fully functional after this cleanup:

- All features work with placeholder values
- Environment doctor shows expected warnings
- Tests pass (except configuration-dependent Stripe tests)
- Ready for `npx dct init` deployment
