# [Backfill Step 01] Baseline Establishment â€” 2025-08-25

## Overview

This PR documents the implementation of OSS Hero Hardening Step 01: Baseline Establishment. This step establishes comprehensive repository health monitoring, baseline metrics, and foundational tooling for the OSS Hero application.

## What This Step Implements

### Repository Health Monitoring
- **Doctor Script**: `scripts/doctor.ts` - Comprehensive repository health checker
- **Health Commands**: `npm run tool:doctor`, `npm run tool:doctor:fix`, `npm run tool:doctor:safe`
- **Automated Fixes**: `npm run tool:doctor:fix` with `AUTO=1` flag

### Baseline Metrics & Reporting
- **Reports Directory**: `reports/` - Contains JSON reports for various system checks
- **Inventory Scripts**: Repository inventory and health assessment tools
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time repository status tracking

### Foundational Tooling
- **Rename Tools**: `npm run tool:rename:symbol`, `npm run tool:rename:import`, `npm run tool:rename:route`, `npm run tool:rename:table`
- **Policy Enforcement**: `npm run tool:policy:enforce`, `npm run policy:enforce`
- **Development Management**: `npm run tool:dev:status`, `npm run tool:dev:kill`, `npm run tool:dev:clean`

## Key Files Modified

- `scripts/doctor.ts` - Main repository health checker
- `package.json` - Added comprehensive tooling scripts
- `reports/` directory - Baseline metrics and health reports
- `scripts/` directory - Various utility and health monitoring scripts

## Evidence of Implementation

### Repository Health Scripts
```bash
# Health monitoring commands
npm run tool:doctor          # Run health check
npm run tool:doctor:fix      # Auto-fix issues
npm run tool:doctor:safe     # Safe mode with timeout
npm run tool:doctor:test     # Test doctor functionality
```

### Baseline Reporting
- `reports/` directory contains JSON reports for system health
- Automated inventory and assessment tools
- Real-time status monitoring capabilities

### Foundational Tooling
- Comprehensive rename tools for symbols, imports, routes, and tables
- Policy enforcement mechanisms
- Development environment management tools

## Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run tool:doctor` to verify health monitoring
- [ ] Run `npm run tool:doctor:fix` to test auto-fix functionality
- [ ] Verify reports are generated in `reports/` directory
- [ ] Test rename tools with `npm run tool:rename:symbol`
