# Security & Vulnerability Management

This directory contains security documentation, vulnerability reports, and monitoring tools for the DCT Micro-Apps template.

## Overview

The DCT Micro-Apps template implements a comprehensive security strategy with:

- üõ°Ô∏è **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuous monitoring of dependencies
- ü§ñ **Renovate Integration**: Automated security updates with prioritization
- üìä **Security Dashboard**: Real-time security metrics and compliance status
- üîç **Threat Assessment**: Regular security audits and risk analysis

## Tools

### Vulnerability Scanner

The vulnerability scanner (`tools/security/vulnerability-scanner.ts`) provides comprehensive security assessment:

```bash
# Run vulnerability assessment
npx tsx tools/security/vulnerability-scanner.ts

# Or via npm script
npm run security:scan
```

**Features:**
- NPM audit integration
- Snyk scanning support (if available)
- Package vulnerability analysis
- Risk scoring and compliance checking
- Automated reporting and dashboards

### Renovate Bot

Automated dependency management with security prioritization:

- **Security Updates**: Critical and high severity vulnerabilities updated immediately
- **Dependency Health**: Continuous monitoring of package quality and maintenance
- **Smart Scheduling**: Non-security updates scheduled for minimal disruption
- **Automated Testing**: All updates validated against CI pipeline

## Reports

### Vulnerability Reports

Located in `vulnerability-reports/`:
- `latest-vulnerability-report.json` - Most recent scan results
- `vulnerability-report-YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Historical reports
- `vulnerability-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Human-readable reports

### Security Dashboard

The `dashboard.json` file contains:
- Current risk score and compliance status
- Vulnerability summary by severity
- Historical trends and metrics
- Security badge status

## Compliance Standards

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Score**: 0-100 scale based on vulnerability severity and count
- **Compliance Status**:
  - `PASS`: No critical vulnerabilities, low risk score
  - `WARN`: Some high-severity issues, moderate risk
  - `FAIL`: Critical vulnerabilities present, immediate action required

### Security Thresholds

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0 allowed (immediate failure)
- **High Vulnerabilities**: Maximum 5 before warning
- **Risk Score**: Maximum 50 before warning

## Integration

### CI/CD Pipeline

The security tools integrate with GitHub Actions:

1. **Renovate Health Check**: Daily dependency health monitoring
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Triggered on dependency changes
3. **Security Gates**: Failed builds on critical vulnerabilities
4. **Automated Reporting**: PR comments with security status

### Development Workflow

1. **Pre-commit**: Security checks before code commit
2. **PR Validation**: Vulnerability assessment on pull requests
3. **Deployment Gates**: Security compliance required for production
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring in production

## Configuration

### Renovate Configuration

The `renovate.json` file configures:
- Security update prioritization
- Vulnerability alert handling
- Update scheduling and grouping
- Auto-merge policies for trusted updates

### Scanner Configuration

The vulnerability scanner supports:
- Custom vulnerability databases
- Severity threshold configuration
- Report format customization
- Dashboard update intervals

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
2. **Security Reviews**: Review security advisories for critical packages
3. **Vulnerability Response**: Address critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours
4. **Testing**: Validate security updates don't break functionality

### For Operations

1. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for security status changes
2. **Response Plans**: Define incident response procedures
3. **Regular Audits**: Schedule comprehensive security reviews
4. **Documentation**: Keep security documentation current

## Emergency Response

### Critical Vulnerability Response

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Run vulnerability scanner
2. **Impact Analysis**: Identify affected systems and data
3. **Patch Deployment**: Apply security updates immediately
4. **Verification**: Confirm vulnerabilities are resolved
5. **Post-Incident**: Document lessons learned and improve processes
