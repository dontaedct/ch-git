# Step 01: Baseline Establishment

## Overview

Step 01 establishes the foundational baseline for the OSS Hero application by implementing comprehensive repository health monitoring, baseline metrics, and essential tooling infrastructure.

## What This Step Means in OSS Hero

### Repository Health Monitoring
The baseline establishment provides a comprehensive health monitoring system that:
- **Proactively Detects Issues**: Identifies problems before they impact development
- **Automated Fixes**: Self-healing capabilities for common repository issues
- **Health Visibility**: Clear understanding of repository state at any time
- **Baseline Metrics**: Foundation for measuring improvement over time

### Foundational Tooling
Essential development and maintenance tools including:
- **Rename Tools**: Safe, automated refactoring across the codebase
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance checking
- **Development Management**: Environment status and cleanup tools
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous repository health assessment

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Doctor Script (`scripts/doctor.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive repository health checker
- **Features**: 
  - Automated issue detection
  - Auto-fix capabilities
  - Safe mode with timeout controls
  - Test functionality for validation

#### 2. Health Commands
```bash
npm run tool:doctor          # Run health check
npm run tool:doctor:fix      # Auto-fix issues
npm run tool:doctor:safe     # Safe mode with timeout
npm run tool:doctor:test     # Test doctor functionality
```

#### 3. Baseline Reporting
- **Reports Directory**: `reports/` - JSON reports for system health
- **Inventory Scripts**: Automated baseline establishment
- **Metrics Foundation**: Structured data for programmatic analysis

#### 4. Foundational Tooling
- **Rename Tools**: Symbol, import, route, and table renaming
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance checking
- **Development Management**: Environment status and cleanup

## Runbook Notes

### Daily Operations
1. **Health Check**: Run `npm run tool:doctor` daily
2. **Auto-Fix**: Use `npm run tool:doctor:fix` for common issues
3. **Status Check**: Monitor `reports/` directory for metrics

### Weekly Maintenance
1. **Comprehensive Check**: Run full health assessment
2. **Metrics Review**: Analyze baseline metrics in `reports/`
3. **Tooling Update**: Ensure all tools are functional

### Troubleshooting
1. **Health Issues**: Use `npm run tool:doctor:safe` for timeout issues
2. **Tool Failures**: Check `npm run tool:doctor:test` for diagnostics
3. **Policy Violations**: Use `npm run tool:policy:enforce` for compliance

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Problems identified early
- **Automated Maintenance**: Reduced manual overhead
- **Consistent Tooling**: Standardized workflows
- **Health Visibility**: Clear repository state

### For Operations
- **Baseline Metrics**: Foundation for monitoring
- **Automated Fixes**: Self-healing capabilities
- **Policy Compliance**: Automated enforcement
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous assessment

### For Maintenance
- **Tooling Consistency**: Standardized approach
- **Automated Cleanup**: Environment management
- **Health Tracking**: Long-term trend analysis
- **Issue Prevention**: Proactive monitoring

## Integration with Other Steps

### Prerequisites
- None (this is the foundational step)

### Enables
- **Step 02**: TypeScript strictness (health monitoring)
- **Step 03**: Environment validation (baseline metrics)
- **Step 07**: CI gate (health checks)
- **Step 09**: Seeds tests (tooling foundation)

### Dependencies
- **Package.json**: Scripts and tooling configuration
- **Scripts Directory**: Utility and health monitoring tools
- **Reports Directory**: Baseline metrics and health data

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Repository health monitoring operational
- ✅ Auto-fix capabilities working
- ✅ Baseline metrics established
- ✅ Foundational tooling functional
- ✅ Policy enforcement active
- ✅ Development management tools working

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Health Check Status**: Daily health assessment results
- **Auto-Fix Success Rate**: Percentage of issues automatically resolved
- **Tooling Functionality**: All tools operational
- **Policy Compliance**: No violations detected

### Alerts
- **Health Check Failures**: Critical issues detected
- **Tooling Failures**: Essential tools not working
- **Policy Violations**: Compliance issues found
- **Metrics Anomalies**: Unusual baseline patterns
